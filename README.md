# Engineer & Side Project Junkie

I currently work with Dynatron Software to deliver innovative products leveraging cutting-edge technologies, and my entrepreneurial drive. I often get to work with big data and cloud technologies to continuously deliver value for customers.  

Right now exploring NYC as I am currently splitting my time between NYC and Barcelona.
